# Some React with Laravel
This is a simple CRUD app for learning purposes

## Objective TODOs
* Finish app UI
* Start components developing
* Add unit testing
* Create back-end
* More?
* Add React Router and Redux

## Crazy TODOs (For my future self)
* How are you going to deal with Atomic CSS like structure and responsiveness? Your ClassNames are already HUGE!
* Why exactly are you not using CSS Variables for some things? SASS vars are neat, but the Browser can't change them
