# Some React with Laravel
This is a simple CRUD app for learning purposes

## TODO
* Finish app UI
* Start components developing
* Add unit testing
* Create back-end
* More?

# To my future self
* How are you going to deal with Atomic CSS like structure and responsiveness? Your ClassNames are already HUGE!
* Why exactly are you not using CSS Variables for some things? SASS vars are neat, but the Browser can't change them
* Add fucking React Router and Redux my boy
